# *Percona Operator for MongoDB* 1.13.0

* **Date**

    September 8, 2022

* **Installation**

    [Installing Percona Operator for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-psmongodb/index.html#installation)

## Release Highlights

* Starting from now, the Operator will not add new API versions to its Custom Resource Definition with every new release. It will use `v1` version from now on, and three last Custom Resource versions will be supported as deprecated ones

* The [cross-site replication](replication.md) feature allows an asynchronous replication between two Percona Server for MongoDB Clusters, including scenarios when one of the clusters is outside of the Kubernetes environment. The feature is intended for the following use cases:

   * provide migrations of your Percona Server for MongoDB Cluster to Kubernetes or vice versa,
   * migrate regular MongoDB database to Percona Server for MongoDB Cluster under the Operator control, or carry on backward migration,
   * enable disaster recovery capability for your cluster deployment.


* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](aks.md) was added to the list of the officially supported platforms

## New Features

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(203) }} Add support for cluster-wide operators

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(287) }} Support hashicorp vault for PSMDB Operator

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(704) }} Include support for Azure Kubernetes Service

## Improvements

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(515) }} Allow setting requireTLS mode for MongoDB through the Operator

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(636) }} Create admin user by default

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(699) }} Disable automated upgrade by default

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(725) }} Configuring the log structuring and detalization [is now supported](debug.md#log) using the LOG_STRUCTURED and LOG_LEVEL environment variables

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(719) }} Details about using sharding, Hashicorp Vault and cluster-wide mode were added to [telemetry](telemetry.md)

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(715) }} to reduce the size of Custom Resource Definition to prevent reaching the etcd limit

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(709) }} Make it possible [to use API Key](monitoring.md#operator-monitoring-client-token) to authorize within Percona Monitoring and Management Server

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(707) }} Allow to set service labels in Custom Resource to enable various integrations with cloud providers or service meshes

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(666) }} and {{ k8spsmdbjira(702) }} Do not use `force` option when reconfiguring MongoDB member

## Bugs Fixed

*  The version overflow lead to cluster stuck at Initializing. 

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(730) }} Fix a bug due to which point-in-time recovery was enabled and consequently disabled when setting Percona Backup for MongoDB compression options without checking whether it was enabled in the Custom Resource

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(660) }} backup error - starting deadline exceeded

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(686) }} Failed to downscale sharding to replica set

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(691) }} Fix a bug that produced an error in the Operator log in case of the empty SSL Secret name in Custom Resource

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(696) }} Unable to delete the annotations on pods by deleting them in spec.replsets.annotations field

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(724) }} Fix a bug which caused the `delete-backup` finalizer not working causing backups being not deleted from buckets

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(746) }} Fix a bug due to which the Operator was unable to initialize a three-member replica set with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(762) }} Fix a bug due to which the Operator was running the `replSetReconfig` MongoDB command at every reconciliation if arbiter was enabled

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
1.13.0:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.21 - 1.23

* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.21 - 1.23

* [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.10 - 4.11

 Azure 1.22 - 1.24 (should be, checking 1.24. it doesn't work a couple of weeks ago)

* [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) 1.26

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are
specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors
and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
